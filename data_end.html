// 2. When the HTML document finishes loading, populate the div
//    (traceDiv) with the visualization
//    corresponding to the trace.

  // 3. Create a new ExecutionVisualizer object for each visualization.

  //    The basic idea is that the parent div name is passed as the first argument,
  //    and the trace object is passed as the second argument.
  //
  //    The third argument contains optional parameters.

  // Note that "embeddedMode: true" makes the visualizer appear more compact on-screen.
  // editCodeBaseURL is the base URL to prepend onto the 'Edit code' link.

  // Render listSumTrace inside of listSumDiv
  var traceVisualizer = new ExecutionVisualizer('traceDiv', traceOutput,
                                                {embeddedMode: true,
                                                 startingInstruction: 0,
                                                 jumpToEnd: false,
                                                 editCodeBaseURL: ""});

  // The redrawConnectors() method needs to be called whenever
  // HTML elements move around on-screen. This is because the SVG
  // arrows rendered by jsPlumb don't automatically get redrawn
  // in their new positions unless redrawConnectors() is called.

  // Call redrawConnectors() whenever the window is resized,
  // since HTML elements might have moved during a resize.
  $(window).resize(function() {
    traceVisualizer.redrawConnectors();
  });


  // A more subtle point is that when some div in your HTML webpage
  // (such as a visualizer div) expands in height, it will "push down"
  // all divs below it, but the SVG arrows rendered by jsPlumb
  // WILL NOT MOVE. Thus, they will be in the incorrect location,
  // unless you call redrawConnectors(). Here is one jQuery plugin
  // that you can use to detect div height changes:
  //
  // http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
  //
  // As a concrete example, drag around the execution slider in
  // "Towers of Hanoi" and notice how the arrows in "Happy Birthday"
  // end up not properly aligned with the other elements.
  //
  // A related trick you can implement is to make a div never shrink
  // in height once it's grown; that way, you can avoid lots of jarring
  // jumps and redraws.
  //
  // Please email me if you want me to add more official support
  // for this behavior.
